  abstract={Data quality stands at the forefront of deciding the effectiveness of video-language representation learning. However, video-text pairs in previous data typically do not align perfectly with each other, which might lead to video-language representations that do not accurately reflect cross-modal semantics. Moreover, previous data also possess an uneven distribution of concepts, thereby hampering the downstream performance across unpopular subjects. To address these problems, we propose a contrastive objective with a subtractive angular margin to regularize cross-modal representations in their effort to reach perfect similarity. Furthermore, to adapt to the non-uniform concept distribution, we propose a multi-layer perceptron (MLP)-parameterized weighting function that maps loss values to sample weights which enable dynamic adjustment of the model's focus throughout the training. With the training guided by a small amount of unbiased meta-data and augmented by video-text data generated by large vision-language model, we improve video-language representations and achieve superior performances on commonly used video question answering and text-video retrieval datasets.},

  abstract={Humans use multiple senses to comprehend the environment. Vision and language are two of the most vital senses since they allow us to easily communicate our thoughts and perceive the world around us. There has been a lot of interest in creating video-language understanding systems with human-like senses since a video-language pair can mimic both our linguistic medium and visual environment with temporal dynamics. In this survey, we review the key tasks of these systems and highlight the associated challenges. Based on the challenges, we summarize their methods from model architecture, model training, and data perspectives. We also conduct performance comparison among the methods, and discuss promising directions for future research.},

  abstract={Previous work on multimodal sentence embedding has proposed multimodal contrastive learning and achieved promising results. However, by taking the rest of the batch as negative samples without reviewing when forming contrastive pairs, those studies encountered many suspicious and noisy negative examples, significantly affecting the methods' overall performance. In this work, we propose KDMCSE (Knowledge Distillation Multimodal contrastive learning of Sentence Embeddings), a novel approach that enhances the discrimination and generalizability of multimodal representation and inherits the knowledge from the teacher model to learn the difference between positive and negative instances and via that, can detect noisy and wrong negative samples effectively before they are calculated in the contrastive objective. Furthermore, to overcome the limitation of modeling the variation within negative pairs, we introduce a new contrastive objective, AdapACSE (Adaptive Angular Margin Supervised Contrastive Learning for Multimodal sentence embeddings), that enhances the discriminative representation by strengthening the margin within the angular space while capturing varying semantics within the negative. Experimental results on widely used Semantic Textual Similarity (STS) benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.},

  abstract={Hierarchical topic modeling aims to discover latent topics from a corpus and organize them into a hierarchy to understand documents with desirable semantic granularity. However, existing work struggles with producing topic hierarchies of low affinity, rationality, and diversity, which hampers document understanding. To overcome these challenges, we in this paper propose Transport Plan and Context-aware Hierarchical Topic Model (TraCo). Instead of early simple topic dependencies, we propose a transport plan dependency method. It constrains dependencies to ensure their sparsity and balance, and also regularizes topic hierarchy building with them. This improves affinity and diversity of hierarchies. We further propose a context-aware disentangled decoder. Rather than previously entangled decoding, it distributes different semantic granularity to topics at different levels by disentangled decoding. This facilitates the rationality of hierarchies. Experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that our method surpasses state-of-the-art baselines, effectively improving the affinity, rationality, and diversity of hierarchical topic modeling with better performance on downstream tasks.},

  abstract={Fully fine-tuning pretrained large-scale transformer models has become a popular paradigm for video-language modeling tasks, such as temporal language grounding and video-language summarization. With a growing number of tasks and limited training data, such full fine-tuning approach leads to costly model storage and unstable training. To overcome these shortcomings, we introduce lightweight adapters to the pre-trained model and only update them at fine-tuning time. However, existing adapters fail to capture intrinsic temporal relations among video frames or textual words. Moreover, they neglect the preservation of critical task-related information that flows from the raw video-language input into the adapter's low-dimensional space. To address these issues, we first propose a novel REcurrent ADapter (READ) that employs recurrent computation to enable temporal modeling capability. Second, we propose Partial Video-Language Alignment (PVLA) objective via the use of partial optimal transport to maintain task-related information flowing into our READ modules. We validate our READ-PVLA framework through extensive experiments where READ-PVLA significantly outperforms all existing fine-tuning strategies on multiple low-resource temporal language grounding and video-language summarization benchmarks.},

  abstract={The effectiveness of a model is heavily reliant on the quality of the fusion representation of multiple modalities in multimodal sentiment analysis. Moreover, each modality is extracted from raw input and integrated with the rest to construct a multimodal representation. Although previous methods have proposed multimodal representations and achieved promising results, most of them focus on forming positive and negative pairs, neglecting the variation in sentiment scores within the same class. Additionally, they fail to capture the significance of unimodal representations in the fusion vector. To address these limitations, we introduce a framework called Supervised Angular-based Contrastive Learning for Multimodal Sentiment Analysis. This framework aims to enhance discrimination and generalizability of the multimodal representation and overcome biases in the fusion vector's modality. Our experimental results, along with visualizations on two widely used datasets, demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.},

  abstract={Topic models have been prevalent for decades with various applications. However, existing topic models commonly suffer from the notorious topic collapsing: discovered topics semantically collapse towards each other, leading to highly repetitive topics, insufficient topic discovery, and damaged model interpretability. In this paper, we propose a new neural topic model, Embedding Clustering Regularization Topic Model (ECRTM). Besides the existing reconstruction error, we propose a novel Embedding Clustering Regularization (ECR), which forces each topic embedding to be the center of a separately aggregated word embedding cluster in the semantic space. This enables each produced topic to contain distinct word semantics, which alleviates topic collapsing. Regularized by ECR, our ECRTM generates diverse and coherent topics together with high-quality topic distributions of documents. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that ECRTM effectively addresses the topic collapsing issue and consistently surpasses state-of-the-art baselines in terms of topic quality, topic distributions of documents, and downstream classification tasks.},

  abstract={Temporal Language Grounding seeks to localize video moments that semantically correspond to a natural language query. Recent advances employ the attention mechanism to learn the relations between video moments and the text query. However, naive attention might not be able to appropriately capture such relations, resulting in ineffective distributions where target video moments are difficult to separate from the remaining ones. To resolve the issue, we propose an energy-based model framework to explicitly learn moment-query distributions. Moreover, we propose DemaFormer, a novel Transformer-based architecture that utilizes exponential moving average with a learnable damping factor to effectively encode moment-query inputs. Comprehensive experiments on four public temporal language grounding datasets showcase the superiority of our methods over the state-of-the-art baselines.},

  abstract={Cross-lingual topic models have been prevalent for crosslingual text analysis by revealing aligned latent topics. However, most existing methods suffer from producing repetitive topics that hinder further analysis and performance decline caused by low-coverage dictionaries. In this paper, we propose the Cross-lingual Topic Modeling with Mutual Information (InfoCTM). Instead of the direct alignment in previous work, we propose a topic alignment with mutual information method. This works as a regularization to properly align topics and prevent degenerate topic representations of words, which mitigates the repetitive topic issue. To address the low-coverage dictionary issue, we further propose a crosslingual vocabulary linking method that finds more linked cross-lingual words for topic alignment beyond the translations of a given dictionary. Extensive experiments on English, Chinese, and Japanese datasets demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, producing more coherent, diverse, and well-aligned topics and showing better transferability for cross-lingual classification tasks.},

  abstract={Multimodal Review Helpfulness Prediction (MRHP) aims to rank product reviews based on predicted helpfulness scores and has been widely applied in e-commerce via presenting customers with useful reviews. Previous studies commonly employ fully-connected neural networks (FCNNs) as the final score predictor and pairwise loss as the training objective. However, FCNNs have been shown to perform inefficient splitting for review features, making the model difficult to clearly differentiate helpful from unhelpful reviews. Furthermore, pairwise objective, which works on review pairs, may not completely capture the MRHP goal to produce the ranking for the entire review list, and possibly induces low generalization during testing. To address these issues, we propose a listwise attention network that clearly captures the MRHP ranking context and a listwise optimization objective that enhances model generalization. We further propose gradient-boosted decision tree as the score predictor to efficaciously partition product reviews' representations. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art results and polished generalization performance on two large-scale MRHP benchmark datasets.},

Unfortunately, those contemporary approaches pay scarce attention to polish representations of cross-modal relations and tend to suffer from inferior optimization.

To overcome the aforementioned issues, we propose Multimodal Contrastive Learning for Multimodal Review Helpfulness Prediction (MRHP) problem, concentrating on mutual information between input modalities to explicitly elaborate cross-modal relations. In addition, we introduce Adaptive Weighting scheme for our contrastive learning approach in order to increase flexibility in optimization. Lastly, we propose Multimodal Interaction module to address the unalignment nature of multimodal data, thereby assisting the model in producing more reasonable multimodal representations.

  selected={true},
  abstract={Current state-of-the-art cross-lingual summarization models employ multi-task learning paradigm,  which works on a shared vocabulary module and relies on the self-attention mechanism to attend among tokens in two languages. However, correlation learned by self-attention is often loose and implicit, inefficient in capturing crucial cross-lingual representations between languages. The matter worsens when performing on languages with separate morphological or structural features, making the cross-lingual alignment more challenging, resulting in the performance drop. To overcome this problem, we propose a novel Knowledge-Distillation-based framework for Cross-Lingual Summarization, seeking to explicitly construct cross-lingual correlation by distilling the knowledge of the monolingual summarization teacher into the cross-lingual summarization student. Since the representations of the teacher and the student lie on two different vector spaces, we further propose a Knowledge Distillation loss using Sinkhorn Divergence, an Optimal-Transport distance, to estimate the discrepancy between those teacher and student representations. Due to the intuitively geometric nature of Sinkhorn Divergence, the student model can productively learn to align its produced cross-lingual hidden states with monolingual hidden states, hence leading to a strong correlation between distant languages. Experiments on cross-lingual summarization datasets in pairs of distant languages demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art models under both high and low-resourced settings.},

  abstract={Recent empirical studies show that adversarial topic models (ATM) can successfully capture semantic patterns of the document by differentiating a document with another dissimilar sample. However, utilizing that discriminative-generative architecture has two important drawbacks: (1) the architecture does not relate similar documents, which has the same document-word distribution of salient words; (2) it restricts the ability to integrate external information, such as sentiments of the document, which has been shown to benefit the training of neural topic model. To address those issues, we revisit the adversarial topic architecture in the view point of mathematical analysis, propose a novel approach to re-formulate discriminative goal as an optimization problem, and design a novel sampling method which facilitates the integration of external variables. The reformulation encourages the model to incorporate the relations among similar samples and enforces the constraint on the similarity among dissimilar ones; while the sampling method, which is based on the internal input and reconstructed output, helps inform the model of salient words contributing to the main topic. Experimental results show that our framework outperforms other state-of-the-art neural topic models in three common benchmark datasets that belong to various domains, vocabulary sizes, and document lengths in terms of topic coherence.},
